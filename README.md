# Image-compression
Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images to reduce storage or transmission costs. Algorithms can take advantage of visual perception and statistical properties of image data to provide results that are superior to generic data compression methods used for other digital data.
The methods we will use:

-FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)

-DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
